Welcome to the Academy Portal project! This web application is built on ASP.NET Core MVC, providing a robust platform for managing an academy or educational institution. It includes user authentication using Identity Framework Core, Entity Framework Core for data access, and AutoMapper for entity mapping.

## Features

- **Entity Framework Core:** The application uses Entity Framework Core as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, providing a convenient way to interact with the database.

- **AutoMapper:** AutoMapper simplifies the process of mapping between different objects, enhancing code readability and reducing boilerplate code.

- **Repository Design Patterns:** The project follows the repository design pattern, promoting a clean and modular architecture for data access and manipulation.

- **Razor Pages UI:** The user interface is designed using Razor Pages, providing a dynamic and responsive experience for users.
